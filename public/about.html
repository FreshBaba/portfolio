<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Adedokun Abdulsalam but people always called me "Freshbaba". I'm a easy going guy, introverted person to be precise but always think out of the box</p>
<p>I started my journey in tech in the year 2022 formally, during my siwes then. I learnt C#(C sharp) and i usually developed project based on window form application. Am doing good at this field because i developed numerous types of project with it but i quitted and turned to became a web developer in the year 2023 after my National Diploma (ND) in polytechnic Ibadan.You are surprised right, the reason why i became a web developer is because is the hot cake in market and as a developer we have to follow the trend and not to be static in one knownledge. so, presently at this year 2023 of september 17 am a web developer and more years to come i may have upgrade my skills because trust me, i will always be relevant to the market and to the world of tech. </p>
